*MOCKUPS WITH BRANDING, COLOR SCHEME & BG ANIMATION*

*The Logo*

The IT & tech brand universe is traditionally populated by creatures, from Linux to Docker, GitHub or Drupal. 
Voil√† another one: the mantik satellite with cute curious eyes! 
Satelles in Latin means "guard" or "companion"; Sputnik I, who inspired our design, has litteraly the meaning "fellow traveler". 
That's exactly what we want to be: a fellow traveler, companion and guard for AI modelers.

The logo is delivered as svg files (mars red, white).


*The Colors*

Many AI businesses have their primary colors settled in the blue-green corner. We deliberately deviate from it. 

Our primary color: 
*light mars red, rgb(170,73,37)*
It's an in-between color, not plain red or orange, so it gives room for ambiguity, but holds enough earthiness to give comfort and confidence.

Our secondary color palette: 
*kiwi green, rgb(169,171,54)
Friendlier, softer than lime green and also an in-between color. 
*ocean turquoise, rgb(2,139,162)
Somewhere in between a working coat and a sunny ocean. 
*jade green, rgb(26,128,128)
Meant to cause some gentle friction with ocean turquoise.

All colors work on white and on black.


*The Background Animation*

The animation grants us some extra attention.
Peacefully drifting clouds symbolize the steadiness we add to the ML business, accompanying the scientist along his journey.
The animation is delivered as SVG file 1920 x 1080 px for further as needed, e.g. to extract svg elements.
